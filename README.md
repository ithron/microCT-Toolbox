# microCT-Toolbox
A MATALB toolbox for working with micro CT images.

## Cortex Segmentation

### Input
Calibrated ÂµCT scan of a bone, two thresholds

### Output
Periosteal and endosteals binary masks

- the periosteal mask includes the complete bone, bounded by the periosteal surface
- the endosteal mask includes only the interior regions of the bone, bounded by the endposteal surface.

The **cortex mask** can be generated by *XOR*ing of the periosteal and the endosteal mask.

### Method
The method used to segment the cortical bone is based on ["Automatic segmentation of cortical and trabecular compartments based on a dual threshold technique for in vivo micro-CT bone analysis" by Buie et al. (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328207005558?via%3Dihub).
The original dual thresholding method by Buie et al. was designed for long bones. However, it doesn't perform very well with (human) vertebrae. Since the dual thresholding method applies 2D morphological operations on each axial slice, the endplates of a verteba cannot be segmented accurately.
In this toolbox, the dual thresholding method is consecutively applied to to every axial, sagittal and coronal slice and thre resulting masks are combined using a logical OR operation.
